# NetBackup

Working on a NetBackup Powershell module based on NetBackup REST api
There already is a NetBackupPS module, but it's based on netbackup commands that are translated into PS objects. 

This module will talk directly to the REST API, allowing for greater flexibility


Module will be tested with PowerShell 5.1 and 6.1
